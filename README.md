## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### **Prerequisites**
* Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)
* A MongoDB Atlas account (free tier available) or a local MongoDB installation

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://your-github-repository-url.git](https://your-github-repository-url.git)
    cd student-grading-system
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend**
    * Navigate into the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
    * Install the necessary NPM packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if provided) or create it manually with the following variables:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_for_jwt_signing
        PORT=5000
        ```
        *Replace `your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string` with your actual connection string from MongoDB Atlas, ensuring you replace `<password>` with your database user's password.*
        *Replace `your_super_secret_key_for_jwt_signing` with a long, random, secure string.*

3.  **Setup the Frontend**
    * Navigate into the frontend directory:
        ```sh
        cd ../frontend
        ```
    * Install the necessary NPM packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with the following variable:
        ```env
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
        ```
        *(This tells the frontend where to find the backend API during local development.)*

### **Running the Application Locally**

1.  **Start the Backend Server**
    * Open a terminal in the `backend` directory.
    * Run the command:
        ```sh
        node server.js
        ```
    * You should see output indicating the server is running on port 5000 and connected to MongoDB.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server**
    * Open a **separate terminal** in the `frontend` directory.
    * Run the command:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
    * Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

You should now be able to interact with the application locally.
